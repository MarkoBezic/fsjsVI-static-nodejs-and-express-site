        .about-bio

          p After 12 years of working on the sales side of the tech industry I decided I wanted to start making and using all of the cool things I was selling. I dove into learning how to code and have comepleted the Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree as well as the Front-End Web Development Techdegree from Treehouse. Along the way I've supplemented my learning by working with a mentor and building my own projects. I'm a passionate life-long learner and am excited about building innovative web apps and continuing to grow my skills as a developer.
